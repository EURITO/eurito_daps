Routines
========

Luigi routines for eurito.core. The batching procedure relies on batchables as described in :code:`batchables`. Other than :code:`luigihacks.autobatch`, which is respectively documented in `Nesta's codebase <https://nesta.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nesta.core.luigihacks.html>`, the routine procedure follows the Luigi_ documentation well.
